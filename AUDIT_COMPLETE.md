## 🔧 Key Configurations

### Static IP Assignments
```yaml
# Reserved IP addresses
192.168.100.99   # Hubble UI
192.168.100.100  # Prometheus  
192.168.100.101  # Grafana
```

### Home Assistant Integration
```yaml
# Prometheus scrape job
- job_name: 'homeassistant'
  scrape_interval: 60s
  metrics_path: /api/prometheus
  bearer_token_file: /etc/prometheus/secrets/homeassistant-token/token
